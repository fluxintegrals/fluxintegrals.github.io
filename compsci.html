		<p>The Computer Science and Engineering page is where the mathematics concepts and physics concepts get applied. Here is where I will upload practicle projects involving Arduino Microcontrollers and their corresponding programming projects. But, this is will be mainly a discussion of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering topics. This will try to cover what first year Electrical Engineers and Computer Scientists take. Things including Linear systems, Circuits, programming, Algorithms, and signals.</p>
		<p>Links to the concept pages and a breif description will be below:</p>
