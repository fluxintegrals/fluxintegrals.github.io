        <p> This is for pure mathematics and some applications, closely related topics(such as mechanics), will be in the Physics page. I will be using this page as a means to explain concepts in mathematics I have learned. This can be useful for others as well as myself. It will range from advanced algebra to Calculus level. If you find anything that is inaccurate or mathematically incorrect, please contact me. Also feel free to contact me if there's somethng you need help with.</p> 
        <p>Links to the concept pages and a breif description will be below:</p>
